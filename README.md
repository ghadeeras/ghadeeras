# Hello 👋 🙂

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, I maintain a few personal projects of mine that rekindle the curiosity that first got me into programming, such as graphics and stuff that I find to be more fun than whatever I do at work. Feel free to check out my repositories!

## Stuff that I am toying with
- WebGPU
- WebXR
- WebAssembly / Binaryen.js
- Rust (the programming language)

## Hobbies
- Music making: violin 🎻🎼🎵🎶 & classical guitar
- Astronomy 🔭🪐⭐️☄️
