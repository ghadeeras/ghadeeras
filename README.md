# Hello 👋 🙂

My name is Ghadeer. I code for a living, and also for the pure fun and creative side of coding. On GitHub, I embark on projects that are intellectually stimulating for me, and that rekindle the curiosity that first got me into programming, such as graphics, audio/music, math, physics, simulation, abstract frameworks, ... etc. Feel free to check out my repositories!

## My To-Learn List
- Rust (the programming language)
- Nim (Python-like systems programming language)
- MatLab
- OpenCL and/or Vulkan
- Cooking! 🍳😁

## Other Hobbies:
- Music making: violin 🎻🎼🎵🎶 & classical guitar
- Astronomy 🔭🪐⭐️☄️
