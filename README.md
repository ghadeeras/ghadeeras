# Hello 👋 🙂

Welcome to my GitHub account! Here, I embark on projects that are intellectually stimulating for me, and that rekindle the curiosity that first got me into programming, such as graphics, audio/music, math, physics, simulation, abstract frameworks, ... etc. Feel free to check out my repositories!

## Hot stuff that I am actively experimenting with
- WebGPU
- WebAssembly / Binaryen.js
- Rust (the programming language)

## Hobbies
- Music making: violin 🎻🎼🎵🎶 & classical guitar
- Astronomy 🔭🪐⭐️☄️
